## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design and hover states in CSS. Below are a few code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>Equilibrium #3429</h1>
```

```css
.hover-state {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on:

- Further mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Improving accessibility with semantic HTML
- Learning more about animations to make UI interactions smoother

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me to better understand Flexbox and improve my layout structure.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN is always a go-to resource for web development concepts.
